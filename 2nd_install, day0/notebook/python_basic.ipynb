    "[1]\tPython 3 returns a floating point value from dividing two integers, but the default for Python 2 is to return the integer part of the division. Thus, in Python 2, 1 / 2 == 1 // 2 == 0. If your code may run on Python 2, remember to add the statement from __future__ import division at the top of your code files, to make sure you get the Python 3 behavior when dividing integers.\n",

    "[4]\tIn Python 2, range returns a list. You can often use a Python 3 range object in the same way you could use a list, so this difference between Python 2 and 3 may not matter for the person using the code. There are things that you can do with lists that you cannot do with ranges, such as adding. For example range(4) + range(5) will work in Python 2 (adding lists), but fail in Python 3 (you cannot add range objects)."
